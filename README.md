## Background
### An Interactive Dashboard on the Current Trends and Health Factors that is shaping people's lives in the United States of America.
The following dashboard shows the analysis of Median age, household income, and poverty rates (y-axis) and their corresponding relationship with smoking, lack of healthcare, and obesity rates (x-axis) for each state in the United States of America.

## Key Findings:
- From the graph, it can be inferred that there is a positive correlation between the state poverty rate (%), and the rate of risk factors % (Obese, Smokers, and Lack of Health Care). When the poverty rate is higher the tendency to get obese, and being a smoker is higher.
- The data shows a negative correlation between household income (Median), and the rate of risk factors % (Obese, smokes, and lack of health care) indicating higher income prevails lower risk factors.
- The age demographic is densely populated within the middle age range from age 30-45. Studies showed that middle-age is the wider age range of lifetime, and at this stage, people start experiencing different life-threatening health factors. People with a good lifestyle and socio-economic status will cope successfully at this stage.

## An Interactive Scatter Plot on the Patterns
To see the relationships, click on any of the factors and hover over it to see the detailed information. The chart shows the relationship between health factors (x-axis) obese, smokes, lack of health care with demographic factors (y-axis) age, household income, and poverty rate.
